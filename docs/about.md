Hi, I am Haley Prengaman! I currently work as a full-time software engineer at L3Harris. I have had two previous internships at Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Lab and Mastercard. If you interested in learning more, visit my Project Tab. 

In Fall 2021, I will pursing a Masters in Computer Science. I have applied to Johns Hopkins and Georgia Tech. These programs are great for professionals because I can work full-time at my job while going to online classes at night.
